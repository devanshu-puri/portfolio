##✨ Core Systems & Features

This portfolio isn’t just a static page — it’s an interactive playground where design, motion, and code fuse together. Each system is crafted to create an immersive journey for anyone who visits.

🚀 Feature Overview
⚙️ System	🔍 What It Does
👾 Immersive Boot Sequence	Launches with a custom ASCII-art loader and interactive terminal. Visitors must enter the right command to unlock the portfolio — a nod to retro hacking consoles.
🌀 3D Scroll-Link Engine	A central 3D model syncs with your scroll. Powered by GSAP ScrollTrigger, it rotates, shifts, and reacts in real-time as you move down the page.
💧 Fluid Scroll Physics	Integrated with Lenis for a buttery-smooth scrolling experience. Every animation feels natural, almost liquid.
🔮 Glassmorphism UI	Sections float on translucent glass panels with soft blur, creating depth against a living, animated 3D background.
⚡ Neon & Glitch FX	UI cards glow with neon edges, while the contact button has a signature glitch animation for that cyberpunk, retro-tech vibe.
🎬 Interactive Components	From rolling hover-text links to animated progress bars, Framer Motion breathes life into every interaction.
📱 Seamless Responsiveness	Built with a mobile-first mindset. Whether on a widescreen monitor or a phone, the experience adapts without losing its magic.
