## ‚ú® Core Features

This is not just a portfolio; it's an experience. The project is built with a focus on creating a memorable and distinct user journey from the moment the page loads.

* **üëæ Immersive Boot-Up Sequence:** The site initializes with a custom ASCII art loading screen, followed by an interactive terminal prompt that grants access to the main portfolio.
* **üåÄ Advanced Scroll-Based 3D Animation:** A true 3D model serves as the central visual anchor, dynamically animating its position and rotation based on the user's scroll progress using GSAP's ScrollTrigger.
* ** buttery-Smooth Scrolling:** Integrated with **Lenis** for a premium, fluid scrolling experience that enhances the feel of all animations.
* **üîÆ Glassmorphism UI:** Content sections are presented on semi-transparent, blurry "glass" panels, creating a sense of depth against the dynamic 3D background.
* **Neon & Glitch Effects:** Features neon glow hover effects on skill cards and a signature "glitch" animation on the contact form button.
* **Interactive Components:** Includes a "TextRoll" hover effect for contact links and animated progress bars for the skills matrix, all powered by **Framer Motion**.
* **Fully Responsive:** A mobile-first design ensures a seamless and visually stunning experience across all devices, from desktops to smartphones.
