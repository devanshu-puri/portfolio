##✨ Core Systems & Features

This portfolio isn’t just a static page — it’s an interactive playground where design, motion, and code fuse together. Each system is crafted to create an immersive journey for anyone who visits.

## 🚀 Feature Overview

- 👾 **Immersive Boot Sequence**  
  Custom ASCII-art loader + interactive terminal. Visitors must type the *right command* to unlock the portfolio — a nod to retro hacking consoles.  

- 🌀 **3D Scroll-Link Engine**  
  A central 3D model syncs with your scroll. Powered by **GSAP ScrollTrigger**, it rotates, shifts, and reacts in real-time as you move down the page.  

- 💧 **Fluid Scroll Physics**  
  Integrated with **Lenis** for buttery-smooth scrolling. Every animation feels natural, almost liquid.  

- 🔮 **Glassmorphism UI**  
  Content sections float on translucent glass panels with soft blur, creating depth against a dynamic 3D background.  

- ⚡ **Neon & Glitch FX**  
  UI cards glow with neon edges, while the contact button features a signature *glitch animation* for that cyberpunk vibe.  

- 🎬 **Interactive Components**  
  From rolling hover-text links to animated progress bars, **Framer Motion** makes every interaction feel alive.  

- 📱 **Seamless Responsiveness**  
  Mobile-first design ensures a flawless experience on any device, from widescreen monitors to smartphones.
